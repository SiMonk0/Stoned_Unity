It's not ideal, but at least I've got this great vantage point. I can see the moon from here, but I haven't dreamt of pursuing it in so long. Good luck in your journey.

text: *takes deep breath*. It's a such a nice day out today, isn't it? Just a perfect day to sit atop a perch and enjoy the view. Why don't you sit next to me? We can spend some time enjoying each other's company. Sounds like a wonderful way to spend a day.
