text: Oh! You're here. It's good to see another unicorn again. It's been so long since I've seen my friends. Have you seen them? How are they doing? Do they still hold out hope? Oh, the cure! I made it up. My friends were so down-trodden when this happened, I just had to do something about it. Please don't tell them the truth. It'll break their hearts. I hope you understand.
