text: Oh, another one! Do you happen to remember anything about being turned to stone? Probably not. But I hear there's a cure. If you can find a way to the moon, the moonicorn might be able to help you. I myself have tried but have gotten stuck here. The lady unicorn to the east has gotten farther than me. Maybe she can help you. Would you, perhaps, say hi to her for me?
