text: Oh, another one! Do you happen to remember anything about being turned to stone? Probably not. But I hear there's a cure. If you can get to the moon, the moonicorn may be able to help you. I myself have tried but have gotten stuck here. There's a lady unicorn to the east who has gotten further than me. Maybe she can help you. Would you, perhaps, say hi to her for me?
